Content Management System - in progress
I'm trying to make a CMS system with a personal touch. 
I'm trying to make just ONE controller for all the pages and i would like to have a 404 page for pages that aren't added by the user.
I'm using twig templates because i'd like to see front end seperate from the back end.
